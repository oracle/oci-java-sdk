 * controlled and who can access it. 2. PrivilegedApiRequest: This is a request object again created
 * by the customer operators who seek access to those privileged apis. After a request is obtained
 * based on the PrivilegedAccessControl for which the api belongs to, either it can be approved so
 * that the requested person can execute the service apis or it will wait for the customer to
