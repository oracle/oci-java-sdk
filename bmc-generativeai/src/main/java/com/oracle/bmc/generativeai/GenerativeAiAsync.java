/**
 * OCI Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art,
 * customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases for text
 * generation, summarization, and text embeddings.
 *
 * <p>Use the Generative AI service management API to create and manage {@link DedicatedAiCluster},
 * {@link Endpoint}, {@link Model}, and {@link WorkRequest} in the Generative AI service. For
 * example, create a custom model by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box model using your own data, on a
 * fine-tuning dedicated AI cluster. Then, create a hosting dedicated AI cluster with an endpoint to
 * host your custom model.
 *
 * <p>To access your custom model endpoints, or to try the out-of-the-box models to generate text,
 * summarize, and create text embeddings see the [Generative AI Inference
 * API](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/generative-ai-inference/latest/).
 *
 * <p>To learn more about the service, see the [Generative AI
 * documentation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/generative-ai/home.htm).
