 * set of all explicitly set fields called {@link Builder#__explicitlySet__}. The {@link
 * #hashCode()} and {@link #equals(Object)} methods are implemented to take the explicitly set
 * fields into account. The constructor, on the other hand, does not take the explicitly set fields
 * into account (since the constructor cannot distinguish explicit {@code null} from unset {@code
