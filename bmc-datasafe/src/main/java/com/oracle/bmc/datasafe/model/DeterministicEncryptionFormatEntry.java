/**
 * The Deterministic Encryption masking format encrypts column data using a cryptographic key and
 * Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128). It can be used to encrypt character and number columns.
 * It can encrypt ASCII data without any input (except seed value), but it needs a regular
 * expression to encrypt non-ASCII data.
 *
 * <p>Deterministic Encryption is a format-preserving, deterministic and reversible masking format,
 * which requires a seed value while submitting a masking work request. Passing the same seed value
 * when masking multiple times or masking different databases ensures that the data is masked
 * deterministically. To learn more, check Deterministic Encryption in the Data Safe documentation.
 * <br>
 * Note: Objects should always be created or deserialized using the {@link Builder}. This model
 * distinguishes fields that are {@code null} because they are unset from fields that are explicitly
 * set to {@code null}. This is done in the setter methods of the {@link Builder}, which maintain a
 * set of all explicitly set fields called {@link Builder#__explicitlySet__}. The {@link
 * #hashCode()} and {@link #equals(Object)} methods are implemented to take the explicitly set
 * fields into account. The constructor, on the other hand, does not take the explicitly set fields
 * into account (since the constructor cannot distinguish explicit {@code null} from unset {@code
 * null}).
