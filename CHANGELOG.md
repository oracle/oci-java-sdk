## 3.0.0-beta1 - 2022-10-25
### Breaking Changes
- HTTP client library is pluggable, choices offered are Jakarta EE 8/Jersey 2, or Jakarta EE 9/Jersey 3
  - The OCI Java SDK does not choose an HTTP client library for you, and there is no default. You have to explicitly choose one, by declaring a dependency on `oci-java-sdk-common-httpclient-jersey` or `oci-java-sdk-common-httpclient-jersey3`
  - Example:

        <dependency>
          <!-- Since this is the "application" pom.xml, we do want to
               choose the httpclient to use. -->
          <groupId>com.oracle.oci.sdk</groupId>
          <artifactId>oci-java-sdk-common-httpclient-jersey</artifactId>
        </dependency>

  - For full examples, see the [bmc-other-examples/bmc-jersey-examples/pom.xml](https://github.com/oracle/oci-java-sdk/tree/master/bmc-other-examples/bmc-jersey-examples/pom.xml) and [bmc-other-examples/bmc-jersey3-examples/pom.xml](https://github.com/oracle/oci-java-sdk/tree/master/bmc-other-examples/bmc-jersey3-examples/pom.xml)
- Invocation callbacks: Instead of using `com.oracle.bmc.util.internal.Consumer<Invocation.Builder>` to register invocation callbacks, use `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.RequestInterceptor` instead, to decouple the implementation from the choice of the HTTP client.
  - Examples of affected code:
    - `com.oracle.bmc.requests.BmcRequest` and any subclass: `setInvocationCallback`/`getInvocationCallback` methods
    - `com.oracle.bmc.objectstorage.transfer.MultipartObjectAssembler$MultipartObjectAssemblerBuilder`: `invocationCallback` method
- Client Configuration has been simplified
  - `com.oracle.bmc.http.ClientConfigurator` has a single `customizeClient(HttpClientBuilder builder)` method, instead of `customizeBuilder`, `customizeClient`, and `customizeRequest` methods. Example:

        IdentityClient.builder()
                      .clientConfigurator(
                              builder -> {
                          builder.property(
                                  StandardClientProperties.BUFFER_REQUEST, false);
                      })
                      // ...
                      .build(authenticationDetailsProvider);

    - Instead of `customizeBuilder` or `customizeClient`, use methods in `HttpClientBuilder`, e.g. the `property` method or the `registerRequestInterceptor` method.
    - Instead of `customizeRequest`, use the `registerRequestInterceptor` method in `HttpClientBuilder` and pass an `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.RequestInterceptor`. The priority controls when the interceptor is executed: lower numbers mean earlier. The request is signed with priority `1000` (`com.oracle.bmc.http.Priorities.AUTHENTICATION`).
    - Specific examples:
      - Setting whether to buffer a request:

            builder.property(
                    StandardClientProperties.BUFFER_REQUEST, shouldBuffer);

      - Setting an Apache connection manager:

            builder.property(
                    ApacheClientProperties.CONNECTION_MANAGER,
                    connectionManager);

      - Setting a trust store:

            // Server CA goes into the trust store
            KeyStore trustStore =
                    keystoreGenerator.createTrustStoreWithServerCa(tlsConfig.getCaBundle());
            builder.property(StandardClientProperties.TRUST_STORE, trustStore);

      - Setting a key store:

            builder.property(
                    StandardClientProperties.KEY_STORE,
                    new KeyStoreWithPassword(keyStore, keystorePassword));

      - Setting the SSL context:

            builder.property(
                    StandardClientProperties.SSL_CONTEXT, sslContext);

      - Setting a proxy:

            builder.property(
                    StandardClientProperties.PROXY, proxyConfig);

      - Setting a hostname verifier:

            builder.property(
                    StandardClientProperties.HOSTNAME_VERIFIER,
                    NoopHostnameVerifier.INSTANCE);

  - `com.oracle.bmc.http.ApacheConnectionPoolConfig` has been replaced by `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.jersey.apacheconfigurator.ApacheConnectionPoolConfig` from the `oci-java-sdk-addons-apache-configurator-jersey` add-on module; or `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.jersey3.apacheconfigurator.ApacheConnectionPoolConfig` from the `oci-java-sdk-addons-apache-configurator-jersey3` add-on module.
  - `com.oracle.bmc.http.ApacheConnectorProperties` has been replaced by `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.jersey.apacheconfigurator.ApacheConnectorProperties` from the `oci-java-sdk-addons-apache-configurator-jersey` add-on module; or `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.jersey3.apacheconfigurator.ApacheConnectorProperties` from the `oci-java-sdk-addons-apache-configurator-jersey3` add-on module.
  - `com.oracle.bmc.http.ApacheProxyConfig` and `com.oracle.bmc.http.ApacheProxyConfigDecorator` have been replaced by `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.ProxyConfiguration`
    - See [HttpProxyExample.java](https://github.com/oracle/oci-java-sdk/blob/v3.0.0/bmc-examples/src/main/java/HttpProxyExample.java)- `com.oracle.bmc.http.signing.RequestSigningFilter` does not implement `javax.ws.rs.client.ClientRequestFilter` anymore; instead, it has been implemented as a `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.RequestInterceptor` to decouple the implementation from the choice of the HTTP client.
- Instead of `com.oracle.bmc.http.JerseyLoggingClientConfigurator`, use `builder.property(JerseyClientProperty.create(LOGGING_FEATURE_VERBOSITY_CLIENT), verbosity)` and `builder.property(JerseyClientProperty.create(LOGGING_FEATURE_LOGGER_LEVEL_CLIENT), loggingLevel)`
- In `com.oracle.bmc.responses.BmcResponse`, the collection used for headers was changed from `javax.ws.rs.core.MultivaluedMap` to `Map<String, List<String>>`, to decouple the implementation from the choice of the HTTP client.
- Circuit breakers
  - The circuit breaker interface has been renamed from `com.oracle.bmc.circuitbreaker.JaxRsCircuitBreaker` to `com.oracle.bmc.circuitbreaker.OciCircuitBreaker`
    - Examples of affectede code:
      - `com.oracle.bmc.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreakerFactory`: Return type of method `public com.oracle.bmc.circuitbreaker.JaxRsCircuitBreaker build(com.oracle.bmc.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreakerConfiguration)` has been changed to `com.oracle.bmc.circuitbreaker.OciCircuitBreaker`
  - Instead of using the constructor of `com.oracle.bmc.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreakerConfiguration`, use the builder. The constructor is not public anymore.
  - Some constants in `com.oracle.bmc.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreakerConfiguration` have been removed, if you need them, replace them with the actual values:
    - `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR_EXCEPTION_CLASS`: `javax.ws.rs.InternalServerErrorException.class`
    - `PROCESSING_EXCEPTION_CLASS`: `javax.ws.rs.ServiceUnavailableException.class`
    - `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE_EXCEPTION_CLASS`: `javax.ws.rs.ProcessingException.class`
  - The `com.oracle.bmc.util.CircuitBreakerUtils` class does not deal with actual circuit breakers anymore, just with `com.oracle.bmc.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreakerConfiguration`. As such, the `DEFAULT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER` field and the `getUserDefinedCircuitBreaker` method were removed. Construct a new circuit breaker from the default configuration if necessary using the build methods in `com.oracle.bmc.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreakerFactory`.
  - The `getDefaultCircuitBreakerConfig` method in the `com.oracle.bmc.util.CircuitBreakerUtils` class has been renamed to `getDefaultCircuitBreakerConfiguration`.

  - `com.google.common.base.Predicate` has been replaced with `java.util.function.Predicate`
  - `com.google.common.base.Supplier` has been replaced with `java.util.function.Supplier`
- Moved classes
  - Class `com.oracle.bmc.Options` was moved to `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.Options`
  - Class `com.oracle.bmc.http.Serialization` was moved to `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.Serialization`
  - Class `com.oracle.bmc.io.DuplicatableInputStream` was moved to `com.oracle.bmc.http.client.io.DuplicatableInputStream`
- Long deprecated code was removed:
  - The signing strategy `OBJECT_STORAGE` was removed from `com.oracle.bmc.http.signing.SigningStrategy`; it had been deprecated for years and had been replaced by `EXCLUDE_BODY`.
  - The `getPublicKey()` and `getPrivateKey()` methods were removed from `com.oracle.bmc.auth.SessionKeySupplier` and implementing classes; they had been deprecated for years and had been replaced by the `getKeyPair()` method.
- Removed code
  - The `setInstanceMetadataServiceClientConfig` method in `com.oracle.bmc.Region` was removed; it never had any effect.
  - `AbstractFederationClientAuthenticationDetailsProviderBuilder.simpleRetry` method has been removed without replacement, since it is not needed in the OCI Java SDK 3.0.0 and higher.
    - You can copy and paste the [previous implementation](https://github.com/oracle/oci-java-sdk/blob/v2.47.0/bmc-common/src/main/java/com/oracle/bmc/auth/AbstractFederationClientAuthenticationDetailsProviderBuilder.java#L494-L528) if you need it.
