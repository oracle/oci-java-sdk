 * Use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Dashboards service API to manage dashboards in the Console.

 * the home region, you won't be able to view those resources in the Console. Therefore, creating
 * resources outside of the home region is not recommended.
 *
 * <p>This service client uses CircuitBreakerUtils.DEFAULT_CIRCUIT_BREAKER for all the operations by
 * default if no circuit breaker configuration is defined by the user.
