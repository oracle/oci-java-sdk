     * <p>Note: This operation consumes a stream.
     *
     * <p>If the stream supports {@link java.io.InputStream#mark(int)} and {@link
     * java.io.InputStream#reset()}, when a retry is necessary, the stream is reset so it starts at
     * the beginning (or whatever the stream's position was at the time this operation is called}.
     *
     * <p>Note this means that if the caller has used {@link java.io.InputStream#mark(int)} before,
     * then the mark will not be the same anymore after this operation, and a subsequent call to
     * {@link java.io.InputStream#reset()} by the caller will reset the stream not to the caller's
     * mark, but to the position the stream was in when this operation was called.
     *
     * <p>If the stream is a {@link java.io.FileInputStream}, and the stream's {@link
     * java.nio.channels.FileChannel} position can be changed (like for a regular file), the stream
     * will be wrapped in such a way that it does provide support for {@link
     * java.io.InputStream#mark(int)} and {@link java.io.InputStream#reset()}. Then the same
     * procedure as above is followed. If the stream's {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel}
     * position cannot be changed (like for a named pipe), then the stream's contents will be
     * buffered in memory, as described below.
     *
     * <p>If the stream does not support {@link java.io.InputStream#mark(int)} and {@link
     * java.io.InputStream#reset()}, then the stream is wrapped in a {@link
     * java.io.BufferedInputStream}, which means the entire contents may be buffered in memory. Then
     * the same procedure as above is followed.
     *
     * <p>The contents of the stream, except when the stream is a {@link java.io.FileInputStream}
     * whose {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel} position can be changed, should be less than 2
     * GiB in size if retries are used. This is because streams 2 GiB in size or larger do no
     * guarantee that mark-and-reset can be performed. If the stream is larger, do not use built-in
     * retries and manage retries yourself.
