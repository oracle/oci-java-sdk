/**
 * Cancellation details for a job. <br>
 * Note: Objects should always be created or deserialized using the {@link Builder}. This model
 * distinguishes fields that are {@code null} because they are unset from fields that are explicitly
 * set to {@code null}. This is done in the setter methods of the {@link Builder}, which maintain a
 * set of all explicitly set fields called {@link Builder#__explicitlySet__}. The {@link
 * #hashCode()} and {@link #equals(Object)} methods are implemented to take the explicitly set
 * fields into account. The constructor, on the other hand, does not take the explicitly set fields
 * into account (since the constructor cannot distinguish explicit {@code null} from unset {@code
 * null}).
