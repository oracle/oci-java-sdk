/**
 * X509CertificateWithOriginalPem is specifically used so that we can keep track of the original PEM
 * encoded certificate, along with the parsed X509Certificate that it creates.
 *
 * <p>When BouncyCastle (standard or FIPs) is installed as a security provider, and is placed first
 * in the list of security providers, the way it parses the PEM file into a X509Certificate causes
 * the ordering of OU entries to be modified. When {@link Certificate#getEncoded()} is called, the
 * encoded form no longer matches the original value that is in the PEM file.
 *
 * <p>When using Instance Principals, we need to send back the original encoded form of the X509,
 * along with it's fingerprint, so that Identity can verify it. If BouncyCastle is used, though, the
 * certificate will look tampered with because the encoded form doesn't match what Identity expects.
 * For this case specifically, we will attempt to get the encoded bytes from the original PEM file
 * instead and pass them back as is, without parsing it to a X509Certificate.
