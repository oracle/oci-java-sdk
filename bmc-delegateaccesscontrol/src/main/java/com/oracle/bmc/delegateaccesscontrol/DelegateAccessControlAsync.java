/**
 * Oracle Delegate Access Control allows ExaCC and ExaCS customers to delegate management of their
 * Exadata resources operators outside their tenancies. With Delegate Access Control, Support
 * Providers can deliver managed services using comprehensive and robust tooling built on the OCI
 * platform. Customers maintain control over who has access to the delegated resources in their
 * tenancy and what actions can be taken. Enterprises managing resources across multiple tenants can
 * use Delegate Access Control to streamline management tasks. Using logging service, customers can
 * view a near real-time audit report of all actions performed by a Service Provider operator.
