     * <p>Assigning, moving, and unassigning a reserved public IP are asynchronous operations. Poll

     *
     * <p>*Note:** When moving a reserved public IP, the target private IP must not already have a
     * public IP with `lifecycleState` = ASSIGNING or ASSIGNED. If it does, an error is returned.
     * Also, the initial unassignment from the original private IP always succeeds, but the
     * assignment to the target private IP is asynchronous and could fail silently (for example, if

     *
     * <p>Regarding ephemeral public IPs:
     *
     * <p>If you want to assign an ephemeral public IP to a primary private IP, use {@link

     * public IP from its private IP, use {@link #deletePublicIp(DeletePublicIpRequest, Consumer,

     *
     * <p>*Note:** If a public IP is assigned to a secondary private IP (see {@link PrivateIp}), and
     * you move that secondary private IP to another VNIC, the public IP moves with it.
     *
     * <p>*Note:** There's a limit to the number of {@link PublicIp} a VNIC or instance can have. If
