     * Management Service API.
     *
     * <p>All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an Oracle-assigned,
     * unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find
     * its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API
     * operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.
     *
     * <p>To launch an instance using an image or a boot volume use the `sourceDetails` parameter in
     * {@link LaunchInstanceDetails}.
     *
     * <p>When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual network interface
     * card (VNIC), called the *primary VNIC*. The VNIC has a private IP address from the subnet's
     * CIDR. You can either assign a private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically
     * assign one. You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the
     * addresses, use the {@link #listVnicAttachments(ListVnicAttachmentsRequest, Consumer,
     * Consumer) listVnicAttachments} operation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call
     * {@link #getVnic(GetVnicRequest, Consumer, Consumer) getVnic} with the VNIC ID.
     *
     * <p>You can later add secondary VNICs to an instance. For more information, see [Virtual
     * Network Interface Cards
     * (VNICs)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm).
     *
     * <p>To launch an instance from a Marketplace image listing, you must provide the image ID of
     * the listing resource version that you want, but you also must subscribe to the listing before
     * you try to launch the instance. To subscribe to the listing, use the {@link
     * #getAppCatalogListingAgreements(GetAppCatalogListingAgreementsRequest, Consumer, Consumer)
     * getAppCatalogListingAgreements} operation to get the signature for the terms of use agreement
     * for the desired listing resource version. Then, call {@link
     * #createAppCatalogSubscription(CreateAppCatalogSubscriptionRequest, Consumer, Consumer)
     * createAppCatalogSubscription} with the signature. To get the image ID for the LaunchInstance
     * operation, call {@link
     * #getAppCatalogListingResourceVersion(GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersionRequest, Consumer,
     * Consumer) getAppCatalogListingResourceVersion}.
     *
     * <p>When launching an instance, you may provide the `securityAttributes` parameter in {@link
     * LaunchInstanceDetails} to manage security attributes via the instance, or in the embedded
     * {@link CreateVnicDetails} to manage security attributes via the VNIC directly, but not both.
     * Providing `securityAttributes` in both locations will return a 400 Bad Request response.
     *
     * <p>To determine whether capacity is available for a specific shape before you create an
     * instance, use the {@link #createComputeCapacityReport(CreateComputeCapacityReportRequest,
     * Consumer, Consumer) createComputeCapacityReport} operation.
