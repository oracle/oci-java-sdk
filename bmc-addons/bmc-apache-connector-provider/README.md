# OCI Java SDK Apache Connector Add-On

## About

The oci-java-sdk-addons-apache is an optional add-on to the OCI Java SDK. The Java SDK now by default supports the Jersey `ApacheConnectorProvider` instead of the Jersey default `HttpUrlConnectorProvider` when making service calls and hence, this sub-module is discontinued.
The classes have moved to the oci-java-sdk-common package. For details, please look into ApacheConnector-README.
