/**
 * This example shows how to change the compartment in which an instance lives. It makes use of the
 * Work Request service to know that this operation has completed and whether it was successful.
 *
 * <p>Requirements for running this example: - Java SDK 1.4.4 or later (you can check this by
 * running oci --version) - An existing, functional CLI configuration. If it is not in the default
 * location, you will need to change the code near the beginning of "main" to match your setup.
